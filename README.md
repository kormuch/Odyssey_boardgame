The Odyssey: Race to Ithaca

This project is a work in progress and I continue to work on it whenever I feel like I have the right mindset.

Embark on an epic journey home in this strategic card-driven adventure inspired by Homer's timeless tale. As Odysseus, you must navigate treacherous waters, mythical creatures, and divine interventions to reach all levels of your homeland before Penelope is forced to choose a new husband from her persistent suitors.
Built around elegantly simple mechanics—either play up to two cards or draw two cards each turn—this game transforms basic choices into deeply strategic decisions. Every card played could be the difference between swift passage and costly delays, while every card drawn might hold the key to overcoming the next challenge.
The tension mounts with each passing turn as Penelope's situation grows more desperate back in Ithaca. Will you risk aggressive plays to speed your journey, or carefully build your hand for the trials ahead? Easy to learn but rich with tactical depth, The Odyssey captures the essence of great board game design in a digital adventure where every choice echoes through your legendary voyage home.
Currently in development, bringing the social strategy of tabletop gaming to the epic world of Greek mythology.
